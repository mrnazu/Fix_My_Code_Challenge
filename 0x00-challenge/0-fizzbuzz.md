# Solution

This code is an implementation of the FizzBuzz problem. The problem asks you to print the numbers from 1 to N, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

The code starts by checking if N is less than 1, in which case it returns an empty list. If N is greater than 1, the program creates an empty list called `tmp_result`.

The code then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to N. For each number, the code checks if it is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the code appends "FizzBuzz" to the `tmp_result` list. If it is a multiple of 3, but not 5, the code appends "Fizz" to the list, and if it is a multiple of 5, but not 3, the code appends "Buzz" to the list. If it is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the code appends the number itself to the list.

Finally, the code creates a new string by joining the elements of the `tmp_result` list with a space between each element, and then prints the resulting string to the console.

=================================

The code does print "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5. To fix this we can modify the code to prioritize the "FizzBuzz" case over the "Fizz" or "Buzz" cases, like this:

```

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            if i % 5 == 0:
                tmp_result.append("FizzBuzz")
            elif (i % 5) == 0:
                tmp_result.append("Buzz")
            else:
                tmp_result.append("Fizz")


        elif i % 5 == 0:
            if i % 3 == 0:
                tmp_result.append("FizzBuzz")
            else:
                tmp_result.append("Buzz")

        else:
            tmp_result.append(str(i))

```
This way, if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is printed as "FizzBuzz" first, regardless of whether it is divisible by 3 alone or by 5 alone. If a number is divisible by 3 or 5, but not both, it is printed as either "Fizz" or "Buzz", depending on which multiple it is. Otherwise, it is printed as the number itself.
